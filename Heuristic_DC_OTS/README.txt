Each "jl" file in this project corresponds to one method to solve DC OTS problem on tested instances in folder "Data". 
Description and examples on how to use the codes are contained in the files themselves.
The codes are initially designed to work in Julia v1.5.2 and JuMP v0.21.5.

Results from these computational experiments on 118-bus/300-bus instances shall be stored in the folder "merged_branch_118" and "merged_branch_300", respectively.
